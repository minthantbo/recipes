        <p>Shan Noodles—one of the most popular dishes in Myanmar—is a perfect blend of rice noodles, a tangy tomato-based sauce, and either chicken or pork, topped with fresh herbs and vegetables. It's not only filling but relatively light, with lots of nutrients coming from the fresh ingredients.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice Noodles</li>
            <li>Shredded chicken: or ground pork</li>
            <li>Tomatoes, garlic, onions</li>
            <li>Spices: including turmeric, paprika, and chili powder</li>
            <li>Pickled mustard greens: for a sour contrast</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs: like cilantro and spring onions</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Place the chicken carcass, garlic, peppercorns and water in a large saucepan.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil then reduce the heat. Allow to simmer for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Prepare the chicken sauce.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a small saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, stir through until fragrant but without catching colour. </li>
            <li>Add chilli powder, diced chicken, tomatoes and soy sauce.</li>
            <li>Simmer gently for 10 minutes until the tomatoes have softened and any liquid has disappeared.</li>
            <li>Prepare the garnishes and cook the noodles.</li>
            <li>Rinse the noodles in plenty of cold water to keep them from clumping together once cooked.</li>
            <li>Put the noodles in a bowl, a generous spoonful of chicken, ladle over with soup including the spinach. </li>
        </ol>
